Feature: Angular demo
  As an AutoQA
  I want to check the Angular page
  So I can show a nice demo, how automation basics work

  Scenario: 1. Name
    Given the Angular page is loaded

    Then test
    And the Angular logo should be visible
    And the "GET STARTED" text should be displayed on the home page
